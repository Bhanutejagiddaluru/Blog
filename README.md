Welcome to my blog repository! ðŸš€  

This is a collection of blog posts where I document my learning journey in AI, Robotics, Embedded Systems, PCB Design, and more. My goal is to make complex topics simple and easy to understand so that anyoneâ€”whether a beginner or an enthusiastâ€”can gain valuable insights.  

Each post is designed to provide practical knowledge, real-world applications, and clear explanations. If you are curious to learn and explore new topics, this blog is for you!
